<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>THE ART OF WOOD
BURNING</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>History of Pyrography</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the most ancient known form of art, beginning from
the cave paintings in the early ages of mankind. Burnt pieces of wood was used
for marking on the walls of caves. The word ‘Pyro’ comes from the Greek word “Fire”.
The Pyrography as in the form of art, dates back to more than 700 years AD from
ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome and China. It continued through the middle Ages,
but its popularity surged during the Victorian Era. With the invention of new
tools, which were used to heat up, the designs were carefully etched and burnt as
a design. Decorative jewelry boxes and coffee tables were the most popular work
of Pyro-art. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In modern practice, electric tools with temperature
adjustment setting are used for intricate designs and effective shading. It creates
an etched design to the wood. In pyrography the grain, texture, and its
imperfections become an integral part of the composition, making each work
unique and authentic in its own way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>About the artist</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I, Shirley Jeff, a pyro artist, have been practicing this
form of art for the past 7 years. I transform the wood into timeless work of
art that combine precision, texture and depth. Over the years I have developed
a distinctive style which highlights the organic beauty of wood when in contact
with fire. This is a highly disciplined art work to produce, having control of
the texture created by each stroke with the burning instrument. It’s a very
unforgiving art as it has no room for errors. Every stroke is meant to be. This
is an artistic expression that bridges traditional and contemporary style. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>About the Artwork</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This artwork is called THE KING’S GAMBIT. Inspired by the
move from the popular game of Chess, is combined with the design of a playing
card. This piece is a part of the ongoing series of the iconic playing cards. This
is the King of Spade, showing the famous move of Gambit in the imaginary world
of a kingdom trying to retain its glory. The torched edges shows the resilient
fight despite the kingdom is burning and crumbling down. The Gambit is the move
of sacrificing a pawn, where all is fair in Love and War!</p>
